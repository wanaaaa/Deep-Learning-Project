We apply our model on untrained dataset for a batch size of 8. Since our model has about 15% accuracy, so we decide the batch size of 8.
Among these 8 datapoints, we use Smallest Margin Uncertainty method to find out 1 datapoint and label it with the most posible label.

There are in total 512,000 files in /dataset/unlabeled. With our method, we convert 12.5% files (#64,000 files) from unlabeled to labeled. 

For the rest 87.5% files(#448,000 files), we don't have enough confidence to believe we can label it correctly with the current model, 
so we need to request the ground truth. We pick 12,800 files which have lowest score in their batch out of these 448,000 files.
